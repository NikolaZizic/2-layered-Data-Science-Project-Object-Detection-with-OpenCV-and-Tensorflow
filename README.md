## Overview
Our idea was to do two separate object detection applications, one that would detect different hand gestures and the other that would detect the face of the user and thus serve as a type of password to the main app. Plus we would use the different hand gestures that we have fed to the learning model to influence certain tasks on our computer like for example: if the app detects a thumbs up gesture it would increase the volume or maybe open Google Chrome etc. For this project, we will be using Tensorflow and OpenCV.

## Motivation
There is nothing more fun than finding your own data to analyzeâ€¦ or at least that is how we think. To accomplish that goal we would need a web-scraping tool. In our case we chose Beautiful soup. Although we are still new when it comes to the subject of data visualization we wanted to push the boundaries even further and try to see if we can analyze specific pictures in order to group them following a certain criteria : in our case a PEGI rating. We tried our best to do the project as professionally as possible and to show our passion for the subject at hand. 

## Technical Aspect

This project is divided into 3 parts:

1. Web scraping video game details on the site in order to find as many information as possible (name, price, genre, availability, supported console) and then grouping it all in a single data frame. We will be using the following modules : 

```bash
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import time  
import re
import pandas as pd
```
2. Data analysis and visualization of said data frame with these additional modules :

```bash
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
3. The last part revolves around downloading all the video game images from the site (also done with Beautiful Soup) and then analyzing said images for their PEGI rating using color detection : 

```bash
import PIL
from colorthief import ColorThief
import io
```
## Installation

The code is written in Python 3.8.5 . If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip.

> STEP 1



#### Windows User

The whole project is built on a Windows OS.  





> STEP 2


#### Collecting images

The first thing is to collect the images. Usually, for a good detection model, at least 20+ images for each label would be required. Since we are using a Tensorflow prebuilt model, the more images we feed our model the more it will be precise but it will also increase the training time. 

#### Labelling Images

We will be using Labelimg that is a graphical image annotation tool. The idea is to clone the repo into a new directory on our PC. In order to run the program there is a few packages that will be needed; The code can be found in the jupyter notebook.

> STEP 3 


#### Choosing a model 

We will be using the Tensorflow zoo that can be found  [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md).Since we want a model with an optimal balance between accuracy and speed, and a box shaped output for our detections, we decided to take the SSD MobileNet V2 FPNLite 320x320.
